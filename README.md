This repo uses [CodeKit](https://incident57.com/codekit/) to manage some SASS things for me (mostly Autoprefixer), but you can use whatever you like!

##To Do
* restrict `announcements` and `giveaways` link flair via [this helpful link](http://www.reddit.com/r/modhelp/comments/1r6q9s/i_dont_understand_link_flair_user_can_edit/cdk7m8o)
* make colored link flair
* stylize headings and content
* create some `@extends` and `$vars` for stuff
* consider replacing the background image with a scanned version of the actual box background because it looks nicer
* add some more minor fancy animations on random things (search, voting buttons, default thumbnails, etc)
* replace the "WORLD OF" typeface with the correct typeface (gotta find out what it is) or scan the actual cardboard
