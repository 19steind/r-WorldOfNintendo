The CSS and images used on [/r/WorldOfNintendo](http://reddit.com/r/WorldOfNintendo). Please feel free to submit your own Pull Requests to help make it more awesome!

**Please note**: this Subreddit is still *really* new, so I'm still building out some of the initial styles to make things awesome. :)

This repo uses [CodeKit](https://incident57.com/codekit/) to manage some SASS things for me (mostly Autoprefixer), but you can use whatever you like!

##To Do
* animate the WoN logo on hover and maybe even on load
* stylize the submit buttons
* consider styling posts - add some fake content to get an idea of how things will look overall
* make snoo image - should follow same style as `#header-bottom-right` element
* create user flair using the images I already popped out for nav items
* consider re-doing the main background to more closely resemble what's shown on the actual product boxes (dots get smaller towards the center)
* replace the "WORLD OF" typeface with the correct typeface (gotta find out what it is)
