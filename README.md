The CSS and images used on [/r/WorldOfNintendo](http://reddit.com/r/WorldOfNintendo). Please feel free to submit your own Pull Requests to help make it more awesome!

**Please note**: this Subreddit is still *really* new, so I'm still building out some of the initial styles to make things awesome. :)

This repo uses [CodeKit](https://incident57.com/codekit/) to manage some SASS things for me (mostly Autoprefixer), but you can use whatever you like!

##To Do
* use a sprite sheet instead of saving individual files for nav stuff
* create some `@extend`s for the commonly shared shit?
* create user flair using the images I already popped out for nav items
* restrict `announcements` and `giveaways` link flair via [this helpful link](http://www.reddit.com/r/modhelp/comments/1r6q9s/i_dont_understand_link_flair_user_can_edit/cdk7m8o)
* make colored link flair
* stylize headings
* add some more minor fancy animations on random things (search, voting buttons, default thumbnails, etc)
* consider replacing the background image with a scanned version of the actual box background because it looks nicer
* replace the "WORLD OF" typeface with the correct typeface (gotta find out what it is) or scan the actual cardboard
